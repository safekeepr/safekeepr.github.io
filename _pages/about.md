My name is Casey Rendon and I live in Chicago, IL. I like to break (computer) stuff, mess with (computer) stuff, understand how (computer) stuff works, and I'm passionate about information security.

The areas that I find myself most intrigued by currently are:

- Malware
- Reverse engineering
- Web security
- DFIR
- Enterprise security architecture

I also love vintage mechanical watches.

I'll think of more to write here... eventually.
