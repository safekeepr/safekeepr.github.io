I finally got around to installing Burp Suite and setting up the proxy/certificate to work in my environment so it'll work with HTTPS traffic and all of that good stuff. It's already proving very interesting. It's certainly a different experience than Wireshark in a way that's making me think I'll like it a *lot* more.

I think we'll see how it pans out and I can give expanded thoughts another time.
