It's been a while.

I figured I should publish a brief - but overdue - update. COVID-19 has put a lid on a lot of things, so I'll jump right in to the topics I've been diving through lately: PowerShell, security operations, and Python.

Python is more of a long-term interest. I just picked up [Python Crash Course](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Eric-Matthes-ebook/dp/B07J4521M) by Eric Matthes - and yes, I'm itching to begin reading it. I'm waiting until I finish up the [Defensive Security Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y18XC5Y) first, though. It's light reading, sure, but I always make sure I finish one book before starting the next. With Python, my goal is to get comfortable and then determine a simple project to tackle. I've learned that's the best way to get comfortable with any new tool: identify a problem, then fix it.

Regarding general security, I also picked up [Cybersecurity â€“ Attack and Defense Strategies](https://www.amazon.com/dp/183882779X)... Yeah, that one's a powerhouse. I can't wait to dig in. It's like the above title, but more technical, thorough, and recent. I'm sure I'll have better thoughts on it down the road.

I know this contradicts what I said up there but I'll probably end up reading the new purchases in tandem. I've noticed the Python Crash Course book is more project-oriented and hands-on so it *should* work out.

Lastly, PowerShell. This one is simple: automate what you hate. There's not much I can share here but I've been challenging myself to find ways to utilize it each day. I'm still pretty new to it all but constantly looking to tweak my playbook and scripts. They mostly revolve around account maintenance, reading information off of domain controllers, that stuff.

Like I said up top, I'll leave this short and end things here. I hope everyone is finding ways to adjust during this utterly foreign time, and most importantly, staying safe and healthy.
